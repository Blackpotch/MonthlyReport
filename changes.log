OVERVIEW...
Some of the main points which need attention at this stage are on the input data
sheet. I need to add a checkbox to toggle the afternoon shift input box on and off.
The sheet numbering algorithm needs to be modified and coded to suit changes in shifts
per day i.e. afternoon, night, day only.

The ribbon XML needs to be modified. The navigation item "Control Centre" is no longer
valid. More years need to be added to the Years dropdown box on the ribbon.

12/6/17**************************************************************************
Create a new checkbox on the input data sheet.
Create a new subroutine on the input data sheet code module.

16/6/17**************************************************************************
Code the subroutine for the new checkbox and modify the subroutine for the night
Shift checkbox.

20/6/17**************************************************************************
Modify the formulas in the Data Input sheet to reflect which sheet number should be
being entered. The main one was Day Shift where a nested IF statement was added.
This should now be ready for testing.

FUTURE MODS - A new sheet needs to be added to collect all the data entered and maintain
the same integrity so as to enable direct import to a database.

Wayne has requested we start tracking Caravans and Campers. Thus:
Add sheet to track Caravans and Campers
Begin mods to the Input sheet
Add lines to Input sheet for Caravans and Campers
Modify custom views to allow for extra lines
Add branch Caravans to GIT for these editions

29/8/17****************************************************************************
Add row in summary sheet to accomodate Caravans/Campers

30/8/17****************************************************************************
Fix the buttons on the input sheet to accomodate for the extra rows and mod the 
Summary sheet to calculate Caravans and Campers

2/9/17*****************************************************************************
Begin modifying the subroutines for the inject data button
Add a column to the midnight shift sheet to accomodate for Caravans and Campers
The inject Night shift sub routine needs some work and an InjectCaravans sub needs
to be created

3/9/17*****************************************************************************
Modify the input locations on the input sheet to accomodate and calculate correctly
I hope, the Caravans and Campers lines.
Modify the midnight sheet so as it actually makes some sort of sense.
Create the InjectCaravansAndCampers sub

***Wayne has indicated this workbook will to sent to Megs. This means the Ribbon XML 
will need to be edited and another list box added for the location so it can be
addapted for use at Pinnaroo and the other stations for that matter.

9/9/17******************************************************************************
Modified the RibbonUI XML and added the xml file to the git repository. Locations are
on the ribbon xml now and the callback subroutine is in place. I think I'm ready for
testing.
***Modify the ToggleNightshift and ToggleAfternoonshift Sub routines and make some
cosmetic changes to the Input Data sheet. Prepare for Testing...
