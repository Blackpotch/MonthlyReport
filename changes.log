OVERVIEW...
Some of the main points which need attention at this stage are on the input data
sheet. I need to add a checkbox to toggle the afternoon shift input box on and off.
The sheet numbering algorithm needs to be modified and coded to suit changes in shifts
per day i.e. afternoon, night, day only.

The ribbon XML needs to be modified. The navigation item "Control Centre" is no longer
valid. More years need to be added to the Years dropdown box on the ribbon.

12/6/17**************************************************************************
Create a new checkbox on the input data sheet.
Create a new subroutine on the input data sheet code module.

16/6/17**************************************************************************
Code the subroutine for the new checkbox and modify the subroutine for the night
Shift checkbox.
